## Questions of Interest


How can we build a dedicated platform that centralizes everything book clubs need — from formation to coordinating book club logistics and finding new books?


## Project Goal


Produce a functional application that serves as an all-in-one book club management tool. The core features include:


- **Calendar** : Schedule and track meetings, reading deadlines, and local events.
- **Forum** : Host discussions around books, chapters, and club decisions.
- **Recommendation System** : Suggest books, events, and groups tailored to user preferences. 


Some nice-to-have features are:

- **Book Locator** : Find where to get an available book (libraries, bookstores, etc.)




## Data Sources


- **SerpAPI API**: Search Seattle book club on MeetUp.com (Info: name of club, link to listing, snippet about club)
-  **Goodreads**: Book popularity, ratings, reviews, and genre metadata 
- **Seattle Public Library (SPL) Data**: Book availability, location info, and "readers who borrowed this also borrowed…" insights
